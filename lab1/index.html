    <div class="poem">
        <div class="character">Fairy</div>
        Over hill, over dale,
        Thorough bush, thorough brier,
        Over park, over pale,
        Thorough flood, thorough fire,
        I do wander everywhere,
        Swifter than the moon's sphere;
        And I serve the fairy queen,
        To dew her orbs upon the green.
        The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
        In their gold coats spots you see;
        Those be rubies, fairy favours,
        In those freckles live their savours:
        I must go seek some dewdrops here
        And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
        Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
        Our queen and all our elves come here anon.

        <div class="character">PUCK</div>
        The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
        Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
        For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
        Because that she as her attendant hath
        A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
        She never had so sweet a changeling;
        And jealous Oberon would have the child
        Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
        But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
        Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
        And now they never meet in grove or green,
        By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
        But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
        Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
